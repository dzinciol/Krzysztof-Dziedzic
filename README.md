## A little bit about me

My name is Krzysztof Dziedzic. I graduated from Teachers' Training College. It has been one of the most important adventures in my life as it prepared me well to the world where English language provides me with access to almost unlimited power (in Emperor's Palpatine voice) - the ability to search for data in English.

I've been working in customer service almost my entire life, but I want to change that. So much, that if hired, you will get the most dedicated person alive as I want to actually have a job where there's no glass ceiling, a job where I will be able to develop skills that are actually benefitial in the 21st century.

I know that this is just the beginning of a new, exciting adventure that I would be delighted to be part of. I’m aware that there’s still a long journey ahead of me (the Dunning- Kruger effect will not be the case here), but I know that the sky is the limit when somebody is motivated.
